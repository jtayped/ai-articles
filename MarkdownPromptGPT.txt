Generate code for a markdown blog post called "[TITLE]". The code for this markdown file should include lots of markdown syntax such as (headings, bold text, block quotes, lists, nested lists, code blocks, Escaping Backticks, etc...) so as to make the text look more appealing. Also be sure to include the title, date, one tag, a 10-15 word description, and an author (Joel Taylor); in the metadata started and ended by "---".
